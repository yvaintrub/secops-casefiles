# 🛡 Demo Case: Threat Hunting Beyond IOCs (Anonymized)

## 📌 Executive Summary
This case illustrates how **threat hunting** goes beyond chasing IPs or hashes.  
By focusing on **behavioral patterns** and ATT&CK techniques, the analyst identified **service account abuse** and lateral movement early.  

**🎯 Outcome:** confirmed abnormal logon behavior, privilege misuse, and lateral movement.

## 📖 Hunt Narrative

- 🔍 Focused on **service account logons** → spotted odd after-hours activity.  
- 🟡 Found **valid account abuse** → MITRE T1078.  
- 🔴 Correlated with PowerShell remoting + LSASS dump.  
- 🟢 Escalated to confirm **lateral movement attempt** → DC recon commands.

|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| 01:10  | 🔍 Abnormal 4624 logons (service account)    |
| 01:25  | 🟡 Remote PowerShell sessions observed       |
| 01:40  | 🔴 LSASS dump attempt via ProcDump           |
| 02:00  | 🟢 Recon on Domain Controller initiated      |

## 🔑 Key Findings
- Abnormal logons triggered hunt hypothesis.  
- PowerShell + LSASS dump linked to credential theft.  
- Lateral movement path confirmed before malware stage.  

---

## 🗂️ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **T1078 – Valid Accounts**  
- **T1059 – Command Line Execution (PowerShell)**  
- **T1003 – OS Credential Dumping (LSASS)**  
- **T1087 – Account Discovery**  

---

## 👀 Detection Use Cases
- Alert on service account logons outside baseline.  
- Detect `procdump.exe` accessing LSASS.  
- Remote PowerShell session logging + alerts.  

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations
- Restrict service account logons.  
- Harden LSASS memory protection.  
- Automate hunting queries into SIEM rules.
