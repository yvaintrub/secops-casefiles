## 📌 Executive Summary
A user reported a suspicious email with an attached Excel file. The file contained an obfuscated macro that attempted to download a remote payload. The payload was blocked by the proxy, preventing further compromise.

**🎯 Outcome:** early user report + proxy block stopped attack before execution.
