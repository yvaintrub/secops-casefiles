# 🛡️ SecOps Casefiles

Anonymized **Security Operations casefiles** covering Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and SOAR Automation.  
Each case includes ASCII attack flows, timelines, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings, plus practical Cortex XSOAR playbooks for automation.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to showcase **practical, hands-on SecOps expertise** through anonymized casefiles.

It demonstrates capabilities in:
- 🕵️ **Incident Response (IR):** building timelines, analyzing attacker behavior, producing executive summaries.  
- 🔍 **Threat Hunting:** hypothesis-driven hunts in cloud and on-prem environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, beyond IOCs).  
- ⚙️ **SOAR Automation:** Cortex XSOAR playbooks for phishing, malware, threat intel enrichment, and AI-powered workflows.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These casefiles are **completely anonymized and fictionalized**.  
Any resemblance to actual breaches, clients, or attackers is purely coincidental.  

👾 In fact, let’s be honest: I made it all up. The only APT here is **“Advanced Pretend Threats.”**
